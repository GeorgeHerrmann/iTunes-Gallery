# iTunes-Gallery
Built using java and JavaFX.
Uses the iTunes API to make a gallery of images based on a user search. The iTunes API may have changed since this project was made in early 2021,
however most of the project should still be working and functionality should be fully restored with minor tweaks.

All code except the driver code was written in early 2021 by George Herrmann
